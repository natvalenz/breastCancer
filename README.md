# breastCancer
The goal of this project is to use Python machine learning to build a model that can accurately predict the diagnosis of breast cancer tissues as either malignant or benign. The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning to classify benign or malignant breast cancer diagnosis based on a portion of the characteristics of a FNA of a breast mass. To use data science to make a complicated and lengthy process an easier one.
